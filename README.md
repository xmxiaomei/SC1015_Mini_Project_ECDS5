## Problem Formulation
**Dataset:** [Diabetes Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset)  
**Problem Statement:** Can we use machine learning to predict diabetes risk using routine clinical and lifestyle data?

**Rationale:**  
Diabetes is a growing global health concern, with millions affected annually. It can lead to severe complications such as cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, kidney failure, and vision loss if not detected and managed early. Early prediction and intervention are essential to reducing both the personal and economic burdens of the disease.
Our analysis and predictive modeling offers a promising approach to identifying individuals at risk before symptoms become critical. By analysing features like age, BMI, glucose levels, and blood pressure, machine learning models can support healthcare professionals in making faster and more accurate risk assessments. This not only helps in early detection but also plays a key role in developing personalized treatment plans tailored to individual patient profiles. Moreover, the insights gained can contribute to public health strategies, prevention programs, and advancements in clinical practices.

## Data Cleaning
Steps taken:
- **Dropped duplicate rows** to ensure model performance and accuracy.
- **Selected relevant columns**, excluding features like "smoking history".
- **Removed rows** where gender was labeled as "Other" to focus on binary gender classification.
- **One-hot encoded categorical variables** to convert them into numerical format without imposing ordinality.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We explored the relationship between predictors and the target variable (diabetes):

### Univariate Analysis:
- Categorical and numerical distributions

### Bivariate Analysis:
- Comparisons between individual predictors and diabetes outcome

### Multivariate Analysis:
- Interactions among multiple predictors

---

## Data Preparation
The dataset was imbalanced:  
**8.82% Positive Cases** vs. **91.18% Negative Cases**

To address this, we used:
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to increase minority class
- **RandomUndersampler** to reduce majority class

This balanced the dataset, improving model generalization.

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning
Models applied:
- **Multivariate Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression**

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
Used `GridSearchCV` for:
- Fine-tuning the **Random Forest** model
- Improving performance on validation data

### Evaluation Metrics:

---

## Ranking Predictors
Ranking predictors helps:
- Improve model interpretability
- Guide further analysis or policy decisions

We visualized feature importances using a **bar plot**.

## Insights and Conclusions

### What We Learned:
- Data preprocessing with One-Hot Encoding
- Resampling techniques (SMOTE, RandomUndersampler)
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
- Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Identifying overfitting via train-test performance gaps
